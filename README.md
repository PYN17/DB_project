# ðŸŒ† Arizona Urban Heat Island (UHI) Dashboard

A **Streamlit-based interactive dashboard** that visualizes and analyzes **Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects** across cities in Arizona.  
The dashboard integrates **satellite imagery, weather data, and air quality measurements** stored in a **PostgreSQL database**, providing actionable insights into urban temperature patterns.

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

- **Dynamic Filtering:** Explore data by **location** and **date**.  
- **UHI Trend Visualizations:** Track how urban heat varies over time.  
- **Satellite Observations:** View spatial heat maps derived from satellite imagery.  
- **Air Quality Time-Series:** Analyze correlations between UHI effects and air pollutants.  
- **Weather Summaries:** Compare temperature, humidity, and other meteorological conditions with UHI intensity.

## ðŸ—ƒ Data Sources

Data is ingested from CSV files into PostgreSQL tables:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `location.csv` | City and coordinate metadata |
| `satellite.csv` | Satellite-derived heat measurements |
| `weather_station.csv` | Weather station locations and info |
| `urban_feature.csv` | Urban infrastructure and land cover features |
| `heat_island.csv` | Calculated UHI intensities |
| `observation.csv` | Observed temperature readings |
| `air_quality.csv` | Air pollution metrics |
| `weather_data.csv` | Historical meteorological data |

**Data Ingestion:** All CSVs are imported and processed via `upload.py`.
